THIS SOFTWARE IS A DEVELOPER PREVIEW AND SHOULD NOT YET BE USED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

Federated Global Directories for the so called "Fediverse" or "Free Web".

Currently supports RedMatrix, Friendica, and Hubzilla fully, with partial support for RSS and Diaspora.

Ostatus support is in the works, and anything with a vCard is coming.

Note this project was originally part of RedMatrix (and RedMatrix still ships with working directories)
and while this repo *will* contain only the directory components, it currently ships with a lot of cruft
which we shall remove over time.
