// configuration denies access to and refuses to serve any file beginning 
// with .ht

// Then set the following for your MySQL installation

$db_host = 'your.mysqlhost.com'; // Use 'localhost' if you aren't using a remote server
$db_port = 0;                    // leave 0 for default or set your port
$db_user = 'mysqlusername';

 *
 * The command-line tool util/config is able to query and set the DB items 
 * directly if for some reason the admin panel is not available and a system
 * setting requires modification.
